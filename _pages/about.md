<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a CS Ph.D. student @[University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), advised by Prof. [Jieyu Zhao](https://jyzhao.net/index.html). Before that, I was a M.Eng student at Graduated School of Creative Science and Engineering @[Waseda University (Êó©Á®≤Áî∞Â§ßÂ≠¶)](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/), Tokyo, supervised by Prof. [Masayuki Goto](http://www.it.mgmt.waseda.ac.jp/) (Japanese only). I also spent my time as a research assistant @[University of Maryland](https://www.umd.edu/), advised by Prof.[Tianyi Zhou](https://tianyizhou.github.io/), and [University of Tokyo (Êù±‰∫¨Â§ßÂ≠¶)](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), advised by Prof.[Irene Li](https://ireneli.eu/). I also work closely with [Jieyu Zhang](https://jieyuz2.github.io/), who focuses on interactive and data-centric AI/ML.

**Research Interests**: My research interest lies in the realm of natural language processing and synthetic data. Specifically, I'm trying to answer the following questions:
- How can we comprehensively evaluate an LLM/VLM in different domains?
- How can we extend ability of LLM/VLM with minimal costs?
- How can we let LLM/VLMs collaborate safely, efficiently, and effectively to solve real-world problems?
