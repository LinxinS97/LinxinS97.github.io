I'm a second-year M.Eng. student in the Graduated School of Creative Science and Engineering @[Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/), Tokyo, supervised by Prof. [Masayuki Goto](http://www.it.mgmt.waseda.ac.jp/) (Japanese only). I also spend my time as a research assistant at @[UMD](https://www.umd.edu/), supervised by [Tianyi Zhou](https://tianyizhou.github.io/), and at @[University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), supervised by [Irene Li](https://ireneli.eu/). I also work closely with [Jieyu Zhang](https://jieyuz2.github.io/) who focuses on interactive and data-centric AI/ML.

**Research Interests**: My current research interests lie in the realms of **Data-centric AI** and **eXplainable AI (XAI)**. I also have a keen interest in Large Language Models and Multimodal Vision-Language Models. My past work has been focused on both the application and theoretical aspects of programmatic weak supervision and active learning.
