I'm a second-year M.Eng. student in the Graduated School of Creative Science and Engineering @[Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/), Tokyo, advised by Prof. [Masayuki Goto](http://www.it.mgmt.waseda.ac.jp/) (Japanese only). I also spend my time as a research assistant @[UMD](https://www.umd.edu/) supervised by [Tianyi Zhou](https://tianyizhou.github.io/), and doing research intern @[University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) supervised by [Irene Li](https://ireneli.eu/). I also work closely with [Jieyu Zhang](https://jieyuz2.github.io/) who focuses on interactive and data-centric AI/ML.

**Research Interests**: My current research intrests is **data-centric and eXplainable AI (XAI)**. I also interested in Large Language Model and Multimodal Vision-Language Model. My past works is related to the application and theory of programmatic weak supervision and active learning.
