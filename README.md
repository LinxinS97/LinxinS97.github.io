I'm a second-year M.Eng. student in the Graduated School of Creative Science and Engineering @[Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/), Tokyo, advised by Prof. [Masayuki Goto](http://www.it.mgmt.waseda.ac.jp/) (Japanese only). I also spend my time as a research assistant @[UMD](https://www.umd.edu/) supervised by [Tianyi Zhou](https://tianyizhou.github.io/), and doing research intern @[University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) supervised by [Irene Li](https://ireneli.eu/).

**Research Interests**: My current research intrests is **Label efficient learning**, which can be expended into multiple fields (e.g. Weak Supervision, Active Learning, Few-shot Learning). Currently, I work closely with [Jieyu Zhang](https://jieyuz2.github.io/) who focuses on data-centric ML/AI.
